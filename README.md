# Maryland Violent Crime

Is the violent crimes rate in Maryland increasing, decreasing, or staying the same? In this project, we will find out. First, we will wrangle the raw data supplied by the State of Maryland. Second, we will analyze the data using a hierarchical regression to examine both the statewide crime rate and crime rate for each Maryland county. Third, we will plot the changes in crime rates for each county.

We will use the crime statistics from the State of Maryland from 1975 to 2016. The Maryland Statistical Analysis Center provides this and updates data.
